Changelog
=========

1.1.3 - unreleased
------------------

* Overrride allowedContentTypes and invokeFactory from PortalFolder
  to mimic the behavior of Archetypes based folders. This allows the
  registration of IConstrainTypes adapters to actually have the
  expected effect.
  [gaudenzius]

------------------

* Fix UnicodeDecodeError when getting an FTI title or description with
  non-ASCII characters.
  [davisagli]

1.1.1 - 2012-02-20
------------------

* When deleting items from a container using manage_delObjects,
  check for the "DeleteObjects" permission on each item being

  [davisagli]

1.1 - 2011-11-26
----------------

  [zedr]

* Ensure that a factory utility really isn't needed before removing it.
  [lentinj]

  where a Dexterity instance is available. (The list of behaviors in the
  FTI is still consulted for add forms.)
  [maurits]

* Explicitly load CMFCore ZCML.
  [davisagli]

* Add ids to group fieldsets.
  [elro]

  generated via script wound up with linked list (and other
  AbstractCollection) fields.
  [cah190, esteele]

* Make setDescription coerce to unicode in the same way as setTitle.
  [elro]

* Change the FTI default to enable dynamic view.
  [elro]

* Setup folder permissions in the same way as Archetypes so copy / paste /
  rename work consistently with the rest of Plone.
  [elro]

  redirecting after edit.
  [elro, davisagli]

  See: http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=113
  [optilude]

* Switch to the .Title() and .Description() methods of fti when used in
  a translatable context, to ensure that these strings are translated.
  [mj]

* Add Norwegian translation.
  [mj]


1.0b4 - 2010-07-22
------------------

* Improve robustness: catch and log import errors when trying to resolve
  behaviours.
  [wichert]

  [wichert]


1.0b3 - 2010-07-19
------------------

* Clarify license to GPL version 2 only.

  [wichert]


1.0b2 - 2010-05-24
------------------

* Fix invalid license declaration in package metadata.
  [wichert]

* Do not assume "view" is the right immediate view - in some cases
  it might not exist. Instead use the absolute URL directly.
  [wichert]


1.0b1 - 2010-04-20
------------------

* Update the label for the default fieldset to something more humane.
  [wichert]

* Make the default add form extend BrowserPage to avoid warnings about
  security declarations for nonexistent methods.  This closes
  http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=69
  [davisagli]

* For now, no longer ensure that Dexterity content provides ILocation (in
  particular, that it has a __parent__ pointer), since that causes problems
  when exporting in Zope 2.10.
  [davisagli]

* Don't assume the cancel and actions buttons are always present in the
  default forms.
  [optilude]

1.0a3 - 2010-01-08
------------------

* require zope.filerepresentation>=3.6.0 for IRawReadFile
  [csenger]

1.0a2 - 2009-10-12
------------------

* Added support for zope.size.interfaces.ISized. An adapter to this interface
  may be used to specify the file size that is reported in WebDAV operations
  or used for Plone's folder listings. This requires that the sizeForSorting()
  method is implemented to return a tuple ('bytes', numBytes), where numBytes
  is the size in bytes.
  [optilude]

* Added support for WebDAV. This is primarily implemented by adapting content
  objects to the IRawReadFile and IRawWriteFile interfaces from the
  zope.filerepresentation package. The default is to use plone.rfc822 to
  construct an RFC(2)822 style message containing all fields. One or more
  fields may be marked with the IPrimaryField interface from that package,
  in which case they will be sent in the body of the message.

  In addition, the creation of new files (PUT requests to a null resource) is
  delegated to an IFileFactory adapter, whilst the creation of new directories
  (MKCOL requests) is delegated to an IDirectoryFactory adapter. See
  zope.filerepresentation for details, and filerepresentation.py for the
  default implementation.
  [optilude]

* Move AddViewActionCompat to the second base class of DexterityFTI, so that
  the FTI interfaces win over IAction. This fixes a problem with GenericSetup
  export: http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=79
  [optilude]

* Add getMapping() to AddViewActionCompat.
  Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=78
  [optilude]

1.0a1 - 2009-07-25
------------------

* Initial release
